  Scenario: ReqRes 1.0 - Get all the users
    Given I have my "ReqRes" API with path "LIST_USERS" ready
    And I have the request headers defined as follows
      | Content-Type | application/json |
    When I send a GET request
    Then I verify the response status code as "200"
    And I verify that all users are displayed with below mandatory fields
      | id         |
      | first_name |
      | last_name  |
      | avatar     |

  #  This demonstrates how you drive your test data within the scenarios as
  #  inline strings and numbers
  #  A json file referenced with path
  #  Single record of key-value pairs
