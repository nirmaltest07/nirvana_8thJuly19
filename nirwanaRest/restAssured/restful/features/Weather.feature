Feature: A REST Example using http://restapi.demoqa.com for weather information
  #  NOTE : YOU CAN RIGHT CLICK and RUN THE SCENARIOS DIRECTLY (if your IDE supports)

  #  This demonstrates how you drive your test data within the scenarios as
  #  inline strings and numbers
  #  multiple records of key-value pairs
  #  Note that this scenario may fail as the wind direction comparision fails if the value is different
  #  If it fails, it gives you an idean on how the failures are handled and reported by Serenity
